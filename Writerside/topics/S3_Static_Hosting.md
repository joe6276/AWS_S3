## What is a Website
When you open a browser and type the name of a website, a request is sent and the response is an HTML file.

So we can say a website is an HTML file.

if all the files are stored in a website, we can:
- Allow access to website files through HTTP
- S3 gives the URL through which you can access the website
- It is used only for static Website.
- To customize a domain for your website, the bucket must follow a specific format.
